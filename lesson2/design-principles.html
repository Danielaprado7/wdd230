            <p>Steam is a gaming platform that sells games and hosts their servers. They have to make sure the visitors see what special offers there is in the moment or when a new game is released. Because of this, they highlight images and links to these offers/releases and the other options are not calling so much attention.
                When you enter the site, whether you want it or not, your eyes go where they want you to see. They understand that the visitors, in this case, the gamers, are always looking for new games or special prices. 
                You can see in this screenshot that the other options are hidden, you have to click on the top left to open up the other resources. You see the games and prices well enough to catch your attention.

            <p>Our mind are configured to do some automatic things. If you are going up or down the stairs you don't even look the  steps because your mind already knows how far is the next one. When we are visiting a website we can use the same principle, follow a pattern, and when all the objects, images and texts are well align we feel much better, is easier and faster to read or find what you are looking for. In this screenshot we can see how things are centered. The buttons in the middle of the image is also well alignm and following a pattern.

            <p>I believe that everybody in the world is amazed by a rainbow. Colors are very powerful! Some studies say that we can actually feel hungry just by seeing some colors, or excited and sad. In this screenshot we can see how the company use the green to evoke the message that they try to pass with their products. If you see green you think about nature. They use here different shades and combine with other colors that just make you feel that these are healthy and natural products.
                They put some white and spaces in here, and even with colors these web site has a clean design, you can read everything without a problem, every image or link is easy understand.
